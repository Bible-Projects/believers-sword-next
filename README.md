## Believers Sword (Official)

I built this apps specifically from my taste of view. I just really want to create an application including the features that I like to have in the application. Im so thankful to God for giving me time to create this application and also to share to others. Im not recommending this application, but I am encouraging you to try the application I built, and hoping that you may like it. I hope we learn learn to study the bible better.
