## Believers Sword (Official)

This is the Believers-Sword new Code Base. Believers Sword App is an application to help you study the bible. Not only that but to engage in learning the word of God. I built this app specifically from my taste of view. I just want to create an application including the features I like to have in the application. Im so thankful to God for giving me time to create this application and share it with others. I'm not recommending this application, but I am encouraging you to try the one I built, hoping you may like it. I hope we learn to study the bible better.

The reason why I recreate the application is to apply good practice because the old code base was made for me to learn electron development and how to implement in real work, I just realize some people are actually using the application, As the project grows I realized that it can become a problem in the future because it was made without planning. So for now I recreated this application to make sure that adding a feature will be easy, this means adding a feature will not be hard.
