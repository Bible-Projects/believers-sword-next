## Believers Sword (Official)

This is the Believers-Sword new Code Base. Believers Sword App is an application to help you study the bible. Not only that but to engage in learning the word of God. I built this apps specifically from my taste of view. I just really want to create an application including the features that I like to have in the application. Im so thankful to God for giving me time to create this application and also to share to others. Im not recommending this application, but I am encouraging you to try the application I built, and hoping that you may like it. I hope we learn learn to study the bible better.

The reason why I recreate the application is to apply good practice, because the old code base was made for me to learn electron development and how to implement in real worl, I just realize some people are actually using the application, As the project grows I realized that it can become a problem in the future because it was made without planning. So for now I recreated this application to make sure that adding feature will be easy, this means adding feature will not be hard.
